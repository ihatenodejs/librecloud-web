## Dev Server Instructions

1. **Install Bun if you haven't already**

   Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime, and is much faster than `npm`. These instructions will be written for Bun, but could be adapted to `npm` or `yarn` if needed.

2. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://git.pontusmail.org/librecloud/web.git
   cd web
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. **Start dev server**

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
