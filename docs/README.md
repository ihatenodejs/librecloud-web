# Welcome to LibreCloud Docs

LibreCloud's web repository is a Next.js web application which serves as out frontend and dashboard for end users of LibreCloud. This documentation will guide you through setting up and developing this interface.

We have made every effort to update and review the documentation and this stands to be the best resource for setting up `web`.

## Requirements

LibreCloud is not one piece of software. It is a bridge between FOSS and a this frontend. This project assumes you have a setup almost identical to that of LibreCloud. With our instructions and some Google searches, you should have very few problems getting setup.

This frontend is optomized for a Linux environment. While support may vary from distro-to-distro, support is prioritized for Ubuntu.

You will need to setup the following services with Docker, and route them properly, based on our [Environment Variable](reference/env.md) requirements. Over time, this will become more flexible.

## Get Started

For the best experience, we suggest you use a [Docker setup](getstarted/docker.md) in production, and a [Dev environment](getstarted/dev.md) while testing/making changes.
